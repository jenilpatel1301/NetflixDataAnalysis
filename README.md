# Netflix Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Netflix dataset using pandas and seaborn libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Netflix dataset, stored in the file `Netflix_Dataset.csv`. The dataset contains information about various TV shows and movies available on Netflix, including their category, title, director, cast, country, release date, rating, duration, type, and description.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the required libraries: pandas and seaborn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas seaborn
```

## Usage
The code in this repository performs several analyses on the Netflix dataset. Here is an overview of the analyses performed:

1. Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
2. Checking the structure of the dataset (number of rows, columns, and size).
3. Examining the columns and their data types.
4. Handling missing values in the dataset.
5. Visualizing missing values using a heatmap.
6. Finding the show ID and directors of the TV show "House of Cards."
7. Determining the year with the highest number of TV shows and movies released.
8. Counting the number of movies and TV shows in the dataset.
9. Listing movies released in the year 2009.
10. Listing the titles of TV shows released in India.
11. Finding the top 10 directors with the highest number of TV shows and movies.
12. Filtering records where the category is "Movie," the type is "Comedies," and the country is "United Kingdom."
13. Counting the number of movies/shows in which Tom Cruise was cast.
14. Listing the different ratings defined by Netflix.

To run the code, simply execute the code cells in a Python environment or run the entire script.
